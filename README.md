# Parse Per Secon

A plugin for Dalamud with the intention of replacing Advanced Combat Tracker.

## To Use

### Building

1. Open up `SamplePlugin.sln` in your C# editor of choice (likely [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)).
2. Build the solution. By default, this will build a `Debug` build, but you can switch to `Release` in your IDE.
3. The resulting plugin can be found at `SamplePlugin/bin/x64/Debug/SamplePlugin.dll` (or `Release` if appropriate.)

### Activating in-game

1. Launch the game and use `/xlsettings` in chat or `xlsettings` in the Dalamud Console to open up the Dalamud settings.
    - In here, go to `Experimental`, and add the full path to the `SamplePlugin.dll` to the list of Dev Plugin Locations.
2. Next, use `/xlplugins` (chat) or `xlplugins` (console) to open up the Plugin Installer.
    - In here, go to `Dev Tools > Installed Dev Plugins`, and the `SamplePlugin` should be visible. Enable it.

Note that you only need to add it to the Dev Plugin Locations once (Step 1); it is preserved afterwards. You can disable, enable, or load your plugin on startup through the Plugin Installer.
